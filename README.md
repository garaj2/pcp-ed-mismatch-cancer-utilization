# My Google Data Analytics Certificate Capstone Project - A Study on Primary Care, Emergency Department and Cancer Surgery Utilization in California

## Introduction

This capstone project proposes a hypothetical business need and apply the skills learned in the Google Data Analytics Certificate course to answer the hypothetical stakeholder questions and fill that need.


## The Question

An insurance/healthcare technology company has asked me to help them identify counties with potential lack of cancer care-coordination within the state of California that could help them modify and target their products towards providing healthcare for cancer patients at an affordable price.

The most common cancers in the United States also tend to be the most preventable ones such as colorectal, lung, and breast cancers. However, gaps in detection of those cancers can be fueled by a 
lack of care coordination among primary care physicians, emergency department professionals, and cancer specialists. In the United States, while primary care physicians are often the first to screen for and identify cancers, minority and underserved populations may first be diagnosed in the emergency department due to poverty, lack of access, or insurance (links: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36374497/, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12284740/, https://academic.oup.com/jncics/article/8/3/pkae039/7682377). Identifying any counties in California with a notable incongruity in primary care (PCP) visits or emergency department (ED) visits versus cancer surgeries for any given year may serve as a quick and easy-to-parse proxy for potential markets for future products.

## The Data

All data is derived from the California Department of Health and Human Services (CalHHS) Open Data Portal. These data are de-identified and freely available to the public.

The datasets used contain information from 2020-2024 and include the:

  • Annual Report for Primary Care Clinic Utilization (link: )
  
  • Hospital Emergency Department – Encounters by Facility (link: )
  
  • Number of Cancer Surgeries (Volume) Performed in California Hospitals (link: )
